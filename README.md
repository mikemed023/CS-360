Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The Weight app has a login/create account main screen in which new users may create a new account and existing users may login to their existing account. Upon account creation an new user will be asked to enter their target weight. Once entered this weight is saved to the database and the user may now access the main screen where they can enter their daily weight values. The user may edit or delete these values. Weight values are saved to the datatbase for future reference. The main purpose of this app is to help users keep track of their weight until they reach their desired weight.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
There is a login/create account screen to start of. This is a way of securing all accounts so that users may only view data pertaining to them. Then there is is the main screen where all the data is displayed, edited, or deleted. Additionally there are fragments so the user can enter a new weight or edit an existing one. These fragments are very convenient becuse they tell the user exactly what to do so they don't have to figure things on their own. The UI is very user friendly with not to many options to avoid any confusion. Users of all skills may quickly login and perform the recording of their weights or view their history without having to navigate through complex menus.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I began coding the functionalities for the login screen and then moved on to the main screen functionality. I tested a long the way fixing as many errors as possible early in the process. I research several ways of translating the requirements into code and went with the ones that seemed more efficient. In the future I can use a similar approach to speed up the development process.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
To make sure my code was functional I created a few dummy accounts and tested all the of the app's features. I struggled to get passed the login screen for a while. The app kept crashing and at points the screen would go completely dark. After some research, I was able to make some changes to the memory and was able to make some progress.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The most challenging part of the development process was the functional coding part. Creating all the necessary classes and making sure they work as they should was one of the biggest challenges. I had to look at many similar examples and try to apply it to my type of app.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
Designing the UI is where I was mostly successful. This is a skill that I learned in a previous course so I was able to apply what I learned then in this project.
